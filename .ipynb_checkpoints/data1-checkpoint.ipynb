    "# Module 4: Working with data\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point we know enough about Python to be able to write some basic programs in our Jupyter notebook. What we don't know how to do yet is to work with information that will help us understand a problem and develop a solution for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most data that we will have access to is stored in *files*. A file is just a collection of information that can be stored on your computer or shared on the Internet. Most of the data we will be using is stored in **CSV** files (comma-separated value files). While you can read these files, they are designed to be easy from programs to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "The types of data science problems we will be working on all follow a similar structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Find* a set of data that you want to use\n",
    "2. *Read* the data into a python data structure\n",
    "3. *Process* the data to find new insights\n",
    "4. *Visualize* your results so that they are easy to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step one is done by looking through our list of data sets, or by finding one that you like somewhere on the Internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "This module is going to focus on step two. Once we have our data set in a file, how do we get it into a format that we can use with Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "The tool we are going to use for reading in and working with data is called *Pandas*. Pandas uses something called a *data frame* to work with our data. A data frame is a lot like a dictionary, with some extra features. Let's see how to get started with reading a CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "For these examples, we're going to work with a data set of cars and trucks and has information about their fuel economy. Our CSV file looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "~~~~\n",
    "  \"\",\"manufacturer\",\"model\",\"displ\",\"year\",\"cyl\",\"trans\",\"drv\",\"cty\",\"hwy\",\"fl\",\"class\"\n",
    "  \"1\",\"audi\",\"a4\",1.8,1999,4,\"auto(l5)\",\"f\",18,29,\"p\",\"compact\"\n",
    "  \"2\",\"audi\",\"a4\",1.8,1999,4,\"manual(m5)\",\"f\",21,29,\"p\",\"compact\"\n",
    "  \"3\",\"audi\",\"a4\",2,2008,4,\"manual(m6)\",\"f\",20,31,\"p\",\"compact\"\n",
    "  \"4\",\"audi\",\"a4\",2,2008,4,\"auto(av)\",\"f\",21,30,\"p\",\"compact\"\n",

    "~~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "This is just a portion of the file, but it should give you an idea of what a CSV file looks like. The CSV file is like a table, the first row has the names of all of the columns, and the other rows have information about specific cars (the table starts with 5 different types of Audi A4). \n",
